## Hi, I'm Anthony Kot üëã

I'm a recent graduate of City University of Hong Kong with a passion for data and a love for basketball üèÄ. I'm currently expanding my data skills through a bootcamp with Generation Hong Kong, where I'm learning to build data pipelines, analyze data, and create impactful visualizations.

* **Weather Data Pipeline:** A project that collects real-time weather data using a weather API and stores it in a SQL database for analysis.
* **NBA Game Data Analysis:** An exploration of NBA game statistics to uncover trends, patterns, and insights.

**I'm excited to learn more about:**

* Machine learning
* Data engineering
* Data visualization 


**My goals:**

* To develop a strong foundation in data analysis and programming.
* To contribute to projects that make a positive impact.
* To become a skilled data professional.

**I'm always open to new opportunities and collaborations, so feel free to reach out!**
